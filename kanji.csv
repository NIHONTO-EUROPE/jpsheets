Those four sections you see in the rice field (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of land, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a "country mile."

Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from melancholy (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material depression we met in Frame 1421).The picture of gloom begins with a small grove of trees, under which we see a crown made out of used tin cans. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of Remembering the Kanji. It is composed of a shovel with a sheaf dotted with small drops on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop shovel attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ "Bulldozing in the sheaves, bulldozing in the sheaves..." ♪ The drops represent the chaff flying about as the sheaves are tossed about by the heavy machinery.There is someone sitting on the ground alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your tin-can crown. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the grove, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-shaping of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of gloom down upon you.A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.}, {ウツ。}, {うっ.する、 しげ.る、 ふさ.ぐ。}, , , {JH}, {Gloom},
